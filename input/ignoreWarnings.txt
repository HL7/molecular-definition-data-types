== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

# Suppressing warnings about using tooling from version 5.0.0 for a version 6.0.0-ballot3 because version 6.0.0 tooling not available
This IG is version 6.0.0-ballot3, while the IG 'hl7.fhir.uv.tools.r5' is from version 5.0.0
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 6.0.0-ballot3 but package hl7.terminology.r5#6.5.0 is based on FHIR version 5.0.0. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try


# Suppressing the warnings about reference to jurisdiction elements (now deprecated) becuase errors in IG Publisher if jurisdiction elements are not present.

# Suppressing messages about references to Draft CodeSystems that we have defined in this IG (we plan to keep these in the IG for the first release)
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/molecular-definition-data-types/CodeSystem/molecule-type|1.0.0-ballot1

# Suppressing external CodeSystem validation warnings since tx.fhir.org does not yet support these codesystems
A definition for CodeSystem 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated
