## Motivating drivers for a specialized Molecular Definition Profiles
Developing a specialized Molecular Definition Profiles to represent discrete genetic data is essential to support clinical use cases that requires reliable genetic information across various applications and institutions. The following paragraphs list some of the motivating drivers for this implementation guide.

### Referencing genetic variations independently of specific patient Observations
 By enabling patient-agnostic FHIR artifacts, Molecular Definition resource would facilitate linking genetic variants to disease associations, drug interactions, and risks of adverse drug events (ADEs), thereby enhancing precision medicine and pharmacogenomics. In addition, this resource can enable seamless integration of genetic knowledge bases with clinical systems like EHRs, ensuring interoperability and real-time access to up-to-date variant interpretations. Additionally, it could support the (re-)interpretation of variants as genomic knowledge evolves, allowing clinical decision support systems to provide the most current guidance. This approach addresses current limitations where genetic data is often embedded only within Observations resource instances, restricting broader clinical and research utility.
