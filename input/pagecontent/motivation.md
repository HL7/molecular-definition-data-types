## Motivating drivers for a specialized Molecular Definition Profiles
Current approaches to representing genomic data within FHIR—whether through existing resources or profiles—do not adequately address the needs of discrete genomic data representation. Feedback from implementers consistently highlights that these methods are often too complex, ambiguous, and insufficiently granular, leading to challenges in accurate data capture, interpretation, and interoperability. This complexity hampers clinical adoption and limits the effective use of genomic information in decision support and research. Therefore, a dedicated, streamlined FHIR resource is needed to provide clear, precise, and user-friendly representation of discrete genetic variants, improving both implementation feasibility and clinical utility.
Accordingly, developing the specialized Molecular Definition Profiles to represent discrete genetic data was essential to support clinical use cases that requires reliable genetic information across various applications and institutions. The following paragraphs list some of the motivating drivers for this implementation guide.

### Referencing genetic variations independently of specific patient Observations
By enabling patient-agnostic FHIR artifacts, Molecular Definition resource would facilitate linking genetic variants to disease associations, drug interactions, and risks of adverse drug events (ADEs), thereby enhancing precision medicine and pharmacogenomics. In addition, this resource can enable seamless integration of genetic knowledge bases with clinical systems like EHRs, ensuring interoperability and real-time access to up-to-date variant interpretations. Additionally, it could support the (re-)interpretation of variants as genomic knowledge evolves, allowing clinical decision support systems to provide the most current guidance. This approach addresses current limitations where genetic data is often embedded only within Observations resource instances, restricting broader clinical and research utility.

### Supporting stakeholders and adopters outside of HL7 that want to use and interoperate with FHIR resources
To ensure broad adoption and interoperability, the Molecular Definition resource and profiles must support stakeholders beyond HL7, including those involved in national and international genomics initiatives such as ONC’s Sync for Genes and NHGRI’s eMERGE phases 3 and 4. Also, it should align with and facilitate integration with the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) specifications and driver projects such as:
- ClinGen
- Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC)
- Variation Representation Specification (VRS)
- Variant Annotation (VA) framework
- Phenopackets.
