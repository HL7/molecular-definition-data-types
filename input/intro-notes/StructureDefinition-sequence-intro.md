### Scope and Usage
The Sequence profile serves as a foundational component of this implementation guide, designed to represent raw genetic sequences such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. It supports multiple formats to accommodate diverse implementation needs. Unlike Allele and Variation profiles that emphasize genomic location, the Sequence profile focuses on the intrinsic composition of the genetic sequence. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in integrating with other profiles within this guide, enhancing their functionality.
