### Scope and Usage
The Genotype profile is intended to represent genomic genotypes as collections of alleles and haplotypes arranged in either cis or trans configurations.

It employs the member element to reference one or more alleles and/or haplotypes, each defined using the Allele and Haplotype profiles, respectively. As with the Haplotype profile, the location element is not used directly in the Genotype profile; genomic locations are instead conveyed through the referenced member alleles. This detailed and integrative structure provides a comprehensive and accurate method for representing complex genetic makeup.
