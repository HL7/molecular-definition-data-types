    <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>

  <p>
    The Variation profile defines a structured approach for representing genetic variations at specific genomic loci. It characterizes the genetic composition at a given location in three distinct states: context, reference, and alternative. This profile leverages MolecularDefinition resource to enable precise communication of genetic alterations. Where applicable, the Variation profile can integrate Sequence and Allele profiles to provide a comprehensive representation of genomic changes, supporting interoperability in health information systems.

  <p>
  To describe a variation using the Molecular Definition resource, it is recommended to utilize the Variation profile. Upon supplying the necessary identifiers and the relevant genomic location as previously detailed, the representation element is composed of three primary slices, each corresponding to one of the defined states: context, reference, and alternative. Each slice is restricted to conveying a single state exclusively. While both the reference and alternative state slices are mandatory to ensure a complete depiction of the variation, the context state slice remains optional but is advisable to include for enhanced interpretative clarity.
