    <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
  The Molecular Definition Haplotype profile is designed to represent genomic haplotypes as collections of alleles residing in cis configuration. It utilizes the member element to reference one or more alleles, each defined through the Molecular Definition Allele profile. Notably, the location element is not employed directly within the Haplotype profile; instead, genomic locations are conveyed through the referenced member alleles. This granular yet interconnected structure provides a robust and precise means of representing complex genetic makeup within a cohesive framework.
