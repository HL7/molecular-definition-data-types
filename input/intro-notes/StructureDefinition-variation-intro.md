### Scope and Usage
The Variation profile defines a structured approach for representing genetic variations at specific genomic loci. It characterizes the genetic composition at a given location in three distinct states: context, reference, and alternative. This profile leverages MolecularDefinition resource to enable precise communication of genetic alterations. Where applicable, the Variation profile integrates Sequence and Allele profiles to comprehensively represent genomic changes and support interoperability across health systems.

To describe a variation, it is recommended to utilize the Variation profile. After providing the necessary identifiers and genomic location, the representation element includes three primary slices: context, reference, and alternative. Each slice conveys only one specific state. Reference and alternative slices are required for a complete depiction, while the context slice is optional but recommended for better interpretability.
